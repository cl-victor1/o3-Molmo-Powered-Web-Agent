# Web Browser AI Agent - Infinite Loop Fix

## Problem
The extension was experiencing infinite loops where tasks would run indefinitely (86+ seconds) without completing. This was caused by a recursive loop in the task completion analysis.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `analyzePageAndContinue` function in `background.js`. When the AI determined that a task was incomplete, it would call `executeActionsInTab` again, which would then call `analyzePageAndContinue` again, creating an infinite recursive loop:

```
executeActionsInTab → analyzePageAndContinue → executeActionsInTab → analyzePageAndContinue → ...
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Recursion Depth Limiting
- Added a `recursionDepth` parameter to track how deep the recursion goes
- Set a maximum recursion depth of 3 to prevent infinite loops
- Modified functions to pass recursion depth through the call chain

### 2. Manual Task Stopping
- Added a "Stop Task" button in the popup UI when a task is running
- Implemented `stopTask` action in the background script
- Added checks in execution functions to respect the stop signal

### 3. Global Task Timeout
- Added a 5-minute global timeout for all tasks
- Automatically stops tasks that run longer than 5 minutes
- Clears timeouts when tasks complete or are manually stopped

### 4. Improved AI Instructions
- Added instructions to the AI to be more conservative about task completion
- Encourages the AI to consider tasks complete rather than continuing indefinitely

### 5. Reduced API Timeouts
- Reduced Molmo API timeout from 60 seconds to 30 seconds
- Prevents individual API calls from hanging too long

## Files Modified

### `background.js`
- Added recursion depth tracking to `analyzePageAndContinue` and `executeActionsInTabWithDepth`
- Added `stopTask` message handler
- Added global timeout mechanism
- Added stop signal checks in execution loops

### `popup.js`
- Added "Stop Task" button that appears when tasks are running
- Added CSS styling for the stop button and stopped status
- Added event handler for stopping tasks

## How to Test the Fix

1. Load the extension in Chrome
2. Navigate to a webpage (e.g., YouTube)
3. Enter a command like "打开第一个视频" (open first video)
4. If the task starts running indefinitely, click the "Stop Task" button
5. The task should stop immediately

## Prevention Measures

The fixes ensure that:
- Tasks cannot run indefinitely due to recursion limits
- Users can manually stop stuck tasks
- Tasks automatically timeout after 5 minutes
- API calls timeout after 30 seconds instead of 60

These measures should prevent the infinite loop issue from occurring again while maintaining the extension's functionality.
