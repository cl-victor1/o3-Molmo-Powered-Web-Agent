# Icons for the Extension

You need to add icon files in this directory before loading the extension.

Recommended icon sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these icons using any image editor or download free icon sets from websites like:

Make sure to respect licensing terms when using icons from these sources.
